## Dialogflow Fulfillment Basic Slot Filling Sample

Slot filling simplifies your agent by letting you obtain multiple, required parameters within a single intent. If any parameters are missing from a user utterance, your agent will automatically prompt users for the required parameters.

## Setup Instructions
1. Click [![AdLibs](https://storage.googleapis.com/dialogflow-oneclick/deploy.svg "AdLibs")](https://console.dialogflow.com/api-client/oneclick?templateUrl=https://storage.googleapis.com/dialogflow-oneclick/slot-filling.zip) to create a new agent from our template.
2. Write or say `hi` in the simulator (top right).
